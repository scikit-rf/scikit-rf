    thres : float between [0., 1.], optional
        Normalized threshold. Only the peaks with amplitude higher than the

    center : number, or None
        center of time gate, in t_unit. If None, and span is given,
        the gate will be centered on the peak.
    span : number, or None
        span of time gate, in t_unit.  If None span will be half of the
        distance to the second tallest peak
    mode : ['bandpass', 'bandstop']
        mode of gate
    window : string, float, or tuple
        passed to `window` arg of `scipy.signal.get_window()` or callable function
    method : str
        Gating method. There are 3 option: 'convolution', 'fft', 'rfft'.

        With *'convolution'*, the time-domain gate gets transformed into frequency-domain using inverse FFT and the
        gating is then achieved by convolution with the frequency-domain data.

        With *'fft'* (default), the data gets transformed into time-domain using inverse FFT and the gating is achieved
        by multiplication with the time-domain gate. The gated time-domain signal is then transformed back into
        frequency-domain using FFT. As only positive signal frequencies are considered for the inverse FFT
        (with or without a dc component), the resulting time-domain signal has the same number of samples as in the
        frequency-domain, but is complex-valued. This method is also know as *time-domain band-pass mode*.

        With *'rfft'*, the procedure is the same as with *'fft'*, but the inverse FFT uses a complex-conjugate copy of
        the positive signal frequencies for the negative frequencies (Hermitian frequency response). A dc sample is
        also required. The resulting time-domain signal is real-valued and has twice the number of samples, which gives
        an improved time resolution. This method is also known as *time-domain low-pass mode*.

    fft_window : str or tuple or None
        Frequency-domain window applied before the inverse FFT in case of the (R)FFT method.
        This parameter takes the same values as the `window` parameter.
        Example: `window='hann` (default), or `window=('kaiser', 5)`, or `window=None`.
        The window helps to remove artefacts such as time-domain sidelobes of the pulses, but it is a trade-off with
        the achievable pulse width. The window is removed when the gated time-domain signals is transformed back into
        frequency-domain.

    conv_mode : str
        Extension mode for the convolution (if selected) determining how the frequency-domain gate is extended beyond
        the boundaries. This has a large effect on the generation of gating artefacts due to boundary effects. The
        optimal mode depends on the data. See the parameter description of `scipy.ndimage.convolve1d` for the available
        options.

    t_unit : str
        Time unit for start, stop, center and span arguments, defaults to seconds (s).

        Possible values:
            * 's': seconds
            * 'ms': milliseconds
            * 'µs' or 'us': microseconds
            * 'ns': nanoseconds (default)
            * 'ps': picoseconds


    Note
    ----
    You cant gate things that are 'behind' strong reflections. This
    is due to the multiple reflections that occur.

    If you need to time-gate an N-port network, then you should
    gate each s-parameter independently.

    Returns
    -------
    ntwk : Network
        copy of ntwk with time-gated s-parameters

    .. warning::
        Depending on sharpness of the gate, the band edges may be
