Currently, scikit-rf uses a direct implementation of the state-space equations. Comparing the simulation runtimes in ngspice, Xyce, and LTspice, there are large differences between the types of equivalent netlists. While the exact reasons for the performance differences are difficult to investigate, it seems like the kind of controlled sources has a big impact in any simulation based on modified nodal analysis (MNA). Voltage-controlled current sources usually perform better than controlled voltage sources. Counterintuitively, the number of controlled sources is not always critical for most MNA circuit solvers, as long as the controlling signal is already present in the solution vector of the linear system. The file size of the synthesized equivalent netlist is therefore not representative of the performance in the simulator.\n",
