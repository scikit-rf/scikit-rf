    "It has long been known that full error correction is possible given a VNA with only three receivers and no internal coaxial switch. However, since no modern VNA employs such an architecture, the software required to make fully corrected measurements is not available on today's modern VNA's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the application of Frequency Extender units containing only three receivers has become more common.  Thus, there is a need for full error correction capability on systems with three receivers and no  internal coaxial switch. This document describes how to use [scikit-rf](http://www.scikit-rf.org) to fully correct two-port measurements made on such a system."

    "To fully correct an arbitrary two-port,  the device must be measured in two orientations, call these forward and reverse. Because there is no switch present, this requires the operator to physically flip the device, and save the pair of measurements. In on-wafer scenarios, one could fabricate two identical devices, one in each orientation. In either case, a pair of  measurements are required for each DUT before correction can occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "While in reality the device is being flipped, one can imaging that the device is static, and the entire VNA circuitry is flipped. This interpretation lends itself to implementation, as the existing 12-term correction can be re-used by simply copying the forward error coefficients into the corresponding reverse error coefficients. This is what `scikit-rf` does internally.\n",
