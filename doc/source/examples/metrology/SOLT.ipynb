    "#### Measure Two Standards Separately\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have two sets of calibration standards, no worries! It's possible to measure reflective standards on each port separately. For example, connect a short to port-1, save a one-port measurement as `short.s1p`, then move the same short to port-2, save another one-port measurement as `short2.s1p` or similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "    short = rf.Network('ideals/short.s1p')  # a 1-port Network\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Measure Two Standards Simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it's possible to measure two reflective standards simultaneously, then to directly store your data as a two-port network. For example, connect the first short standard to port-1 and a second short to port-2, and save everything as a two-port measurement, such as `short,short.s2p` or similar.\n",

    "#### Isolation Calibration\n",

    "For Open, Short, and Load calibrations, even though the inputs are supplied to scikit-rf as 2-port networks with four S-parameters in each, $S_{21}$, and $S_{12}$ are ignored - by definition, both are equal to 0. Only $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ are used, this is true even for a Load-Load measurement. Thus, no isolation calibration takes place by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "If isolation calibration is needed, one must explicitly tell scikit-rf to do so. Specifically, `SOLT()` class accepts an optional parameter `isolation` for this purpose. To calibrate isolation, set this parameter to a two-port network, representing the measurement result with loads on both ports."
