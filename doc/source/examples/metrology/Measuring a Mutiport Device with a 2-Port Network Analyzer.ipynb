To build the full 3-ports `Network`, one needs to provide a list of these 3 (sub)networks to the scikit-rf builtin function `n_twoports_2_nport`. While the order of the measurements in the list is not important, pay attention to define the `Network.name` properties of these subnetworks to contain the port index, for example `p12` for the measurement between ports 1&2 or `p23` between 2&3, etc.\n",

    "During measurements, each port is terminated with a consistent termination. So port 1 is always terminated with $Z_1$ when not being measured. Once measured, each sub-network is re-normalized to these port impedances. Think about that. Finally, the composite network is constructed, and  may then be re-normalized to the desired system impedance, say $50$ ohm. \n",
