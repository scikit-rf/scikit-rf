    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-rf, a calibration standard is treated just as a regular one-port or\n",
    "two-port `skrf.Network`, defined by its full S-parameters. It can represent\n",
    "reflection, transmission, load, and even arbitrary-impedance standards. Since\n",
    "no additional errors are introduced in circuit modeling and fitting, this\n",
    "approach allows the highest calibration accuracy, and is known as a\n",
    "*data-based standard* in the terminology of VNA vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, traditionally, VNA calibration standards are defined using a circuit\n",
    "model with fitted coefficients. Since many such calibration kits are still\n",
    "being used and manufactured, especially in low-frequency applications, this\n",
    "necessitates the creation of their network models before they can be used in\n",
    "scikit-rf's calibration routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example explains network creation from coefficients given in both the\n",
    "HP-Agilent-Keysight format and the Rohde & Schwarz / Anritsu format. Both\n",
    "are essentially the same circuit model, but the latter format uses different\n",
    "units of measurement for an offset transmission line.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. warning::\n",
    "Only coaxial standards are covered by this guide. The calculation is different\n",
    "for waveguides. In particular, the scaling by $\\sqrt{\\text{GHz}}$ for coaxial\n",
    "lines cannot be applied to waveguides because loss is also a function of their\n",
    "physical dimensions, with significant more complicated formulas. Do you have\n",
    "waveguide experience? If so, you can help by\n",

    "## Alternatives to scikit-rf Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, it's worth pointing out some alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-rf, you are able to use any existing standard definition by\n",
    "its S-parameters. If you already have your standard defined as a network\n",
    "in other tools (e.g. in your favorite circuit simulator, or actual\n",
    "measurements results), you can simply export the S-parameters to Touchstone\n",
    "files for use in scikit-rf. Similarly, if you're already using a data-based\n",
    "calibration standard, it should be possible to use its data directly. The\n",
    "S-parameters may be stored in device-specific file formats, consult your\n",
    "vendor on whether they can be exported as a Touchstone file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally,\n",
    "for non-critical measurements below 1 GHz, sometimes one can assume\n",
    "the calibration standards are ideal. In scikit-rf, one can create ideal\n",
    "responses conveniently by defining an ideal transmission line and calling\n",
    "the `short()`, `open()`, `match()`, and `thru()` methods (explained\n",
    "in the [Preparation](#preparation) section).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: HP-Agilent-Keysight Coefficient Format\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start creating their network definitions, we first need to know\n",
    "the underlying circuit model and the meaning of these coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Circuit Schematic](calkit-schematic.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As this schematic shows, this is the HP-Agilent-Keysight model for\n",
    "a calibration standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part is an \"offset\" lossy transmission\n",
    "line, defined using three parameters: (1) A real characteristic impedance\n",
    "of a lossless line. This is usually the system impedance, and it matches the\n",
    "VNA port impedance. However, sometimes a value slightly different from the port\n",
    "impedance is used to model imperfections in the standard. For example, 50.209\n",
    "Ω or 49.992 Ω. Also, waveguide standards use a special normalized value `1`.\n",
    "(2) A delay - represents its electrical\n",
    "length, given in picoseconds, and (3) a loss. The loss is given in a somewhat\n",
    "unusual unit - gigaohms per second. With the three parameters, one can\n",
    "calculate the *propagation constant* ($\\gamma$) and the complex\n",
    "*characteristic impedance* ($Z_c$) of the lossy line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shunt impedance is connected at the end of the transmission line,\n",
    "and models the distributed capacitance or inductance\n",
    "in the open or short standard. It's given as a third-degree\n",
    "polynomial with four coefficients, $y(f) = a_0 + a_1 f + a_2 f^2 + a_3 f^3$, where $f$ is the frequency and $a_i$ are the coefficients.\n",

    "the first constant term is in picohenry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neglected Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The short standard may sometimes be modeled only in terms of an offset\n",
    "delay and offset loss, without a shunt impedance. Since the behavior of\n",
    "a low-inductance short circuit is reasonably linear at low frequency, one can model it as an extra delay term with acceptable accuracy.\n",

    "A matched load generates little reflection, thus it's often simply modeled as\n",

    "is given a zero offset delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thru standard is sometimes modeled with an offset delay only, without loss,\n",
    "for two reasons: loss is negligible at low frequencies, and when the Unknown Thru\n",
    "calibration algorithm is used, the exact characteristics of the Thru is unimportant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, when the Thru is used as a \"flush\" thru, which is the case in most\n",
    "traditional SOLT calibrations - port 1 and port 2 are connected directly without\n",
    "any adapters in the Thru step. Thus, by definition, the thru standard is completely\n",
    "ideal and has zero length, no modeling is required (in the table above, Keysight\n",
    "still gives an offset loss for Load and Thru, but both should be modeled\n",
    "as ideals because the listed offset delay is zero, essentially removing the offset\n",
