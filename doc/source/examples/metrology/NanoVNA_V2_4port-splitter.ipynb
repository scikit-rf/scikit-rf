    "The NanoVNA V2 is a 1.5-port VNA, meaning it can only measure the forward reflection and transmission coefficients $S_{11}$ and $S_{21}$ with its two ports. This is known as a three-receiver VNA architecture, still, fully-calibrated two-port measurements are possible despite this limitation. We recommend the readers to read [Calibration With Three Receivers](./Calibration With Three Receivers.ipynb) first to familiarize themselves with the basic background.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to measure the reverse coefficients $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$ of a 2-port, it needs to be measured a second time with the port orientation physically flipped (or fake-flipped), as explained in [this example](TwoPortOnePath, EnhancedResponse, and FakeFlip.ipynb). The issue gets worse if the device under test (DUT) has even more ports, as described in [this example](./Measuring a Mutiport Device with a 2-Port Network Analyzer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a [4-port SMA power splitter](https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=ZX10Q-2-19-S%2B) is measured with a NanoVNA V2 using the Matched Port technique. It involves measuring the 4-port in all port combinations (12 measurements) with the unused ports terminated with a 50-Ohm match. For the VNA calibration, four more measurements with the SMA calibration standards are required (SHORT, OPEN, MATCH, THROUGH). The manufacturer of the DUT provides measured S-parameters on their website, which will later be used for comparison."
