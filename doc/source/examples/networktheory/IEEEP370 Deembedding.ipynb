    "The [IEEEP370 standards](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/370/6165/) provides good practices for ensuring the quality of measured data for high-frequency electrical interconnects at frequencies up to 50 GHz. It recommends methods and processes for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of measured data for signals with frequency content up to 50 GHz, in particular for removing test fixture and instrumentation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, and following the standard proposal on labelling, a 2-port DUT have one fixture attached to each of its port. The fixture attached to the single-ended DUT port 1 is labeled as FIX-1. The fixture attached to the single-ended DUT port 2 is labeled as FIX-2. The name of the fixture is shortened to FIX and the composite structure as FIX-DUT-FIX. The combination of the DUT and fixtures on either end is referred to as the composite structure or the FIX-DUT-FIX structure.\n",
