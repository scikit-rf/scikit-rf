    "In Fig.1 above, a coaxial balun is depicted and is comprised of a 4-port (outer conductor floating) coax and a resistor. In this circuit, the resistor is employed to model the effect of a ferrite sleeve (or bead) around the coax. The resistor acts to discourage current flow on the outside surface of the outer conductor, which makes the coax behave exactly like a twisted pair of wires over a bandwidth of interest. In some cases, a lumped inductor can replace the resistor to model the frequency-dependent behavior of the ferrite material of the sleeve. The actual value of the resistor, or the inductor, is a function of the frequency range of the design and the characteristics of the ferrite material. Often, the value of the resistor, or inductor, is derived from experimental measurements in the lab. We use 333-Ohms here as a reasonable value to demonstrate the usage of scikit-rf only.\n",
