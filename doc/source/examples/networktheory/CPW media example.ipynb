    "A coplanar waveguide (CPW) is a planar transmission line where the return path is a plane located on both sides of a strip conductor on the same layer. The characteristic impedance depends on the strip width and the gap with the return plane, giving two degrees of freedom to the designer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great advantage of CPW is the convenience to perform shunts or series connections with components because both the signal and the return path are on the same side, thus no via is required. On the other hand, the large coplanar planes require a lot of area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coplanar waveguide has quasi-TEM mode and less dispersion than microstrip. To avoid the propagation of parasitic slotline mode, the planes on both sides of the strip have to be connected together. This could be done using air bridges on MMICs or by adding a conductor plane on the backside of the substrate and connecting all planes together with via fences. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using conductor backing, the line could behave like a microstrip line instead, should the height of the substrate be small and the gap with coplanar planes be big.\n",
